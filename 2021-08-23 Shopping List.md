### Resin
##### Notes
Sadly, I could not find a suitable lost wax resin. The Formlabs Castable Wax Resin requires a specific Formlabs tank and the other one I found is around $120 USD. I may be looking in the wrong place?

### Other
##### Notes
Due to needing to wash and cure the part after printing there is the option of getting a Wash and Cure machine. Not completely necessary and costs quite a bit. I know someone who has an isopropyl tray for washing and a UV lamp for curing and he says it works quite well so I can just use this setup.
